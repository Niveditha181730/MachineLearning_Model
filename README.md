# MachineLearning_Model
To train and develop a machine learning model for regression and classification of customer_segmentation dataset from Kaggle


Languages/Tools: python, Machine Learning, Jupiter notebook, PyCharm, sypder 

Project Description: Different supervised Machine Learning (ML) Models was applied to a dataset taken from Kaggle to determine which models yields the best outcome. Models such as Logistic Regression, Linear Regression-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree are applied to the dataset and to each model feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, data balancing are done to experiment and seek the model that best fit the prediction of the dataset and produce the highest accuracy.
